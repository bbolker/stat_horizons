"Mixed Models in the Wild: Techniques, Workflows, and Challenges"

![](pix/64px-CC_BY-SA_icon.svg.png)

## Notes

* lecture 1 ([HTML](lecture_1.html), [PDF](lecture_1.pdf))
* lecture 2 [live coding] ([HTML](lecture_2.html), [PDF](lecture_2.pdf))
* lecture 3 ([HTML](lecture_3.html), [PDF](lecture_3.pdf))
* [ridiculously complete bibliography](glmm_bib.html)
* [scratch notes from the lecture](scratch_notes.R)

## Setup material

You don't need to install/set up anything unless you want to follow along with the second hour of lecture (live coding). If you do, you should have

* recent versions (>=4.4) of R and RStudio
* the packages below (download the file and `source("install_pkgs.R")` in R or click on the 'source' button in RStudio
* if you get warnings when loading the `glmmTMB` package, try
```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages('glmmTMB',
     repos = c('https://glmmtmb.r-universe.dev', 'https://cloud.r-project.org'))
```
(if this doesn't fix it please let me know, although the warnings are probably harmless)

* [install_pkgs.R](install_pkgs.R)
* [Rmarkdown for lecture 2](lecture_2.rmd)
* [pre-built outputs](https://github.com/bbolker/stat_horizons/tree/main/outputs)
* [data](https://github.com/bbolker/stat_horizons/tree/main/data) ("ecoreg.rds" is the only file you'll need for the workshop)
