# Stat Horizons brain dump

## concepts

* shrinkage; steal shrinkage plots from elsewhere? https://m-clark.github.io/mixed-models-with-R/introduction.html is CC-BY-SA
* 1-way ANOVA
* everything is latent variables/corrs (and conditional distributions) [Ives, mgcv, ...]

## workflow

* dealing with singularity!
* how many models?

## challenges

* scaling/computational costs
* model selection (automated?)
    * criteria: simplicity, defensibility, theoretical validity, properties from simulation ...
* model diagnosis
