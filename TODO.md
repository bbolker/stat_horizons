## lecture 1: to add

* REML
* formula table spacing
* 2D shrinkage plots (based on sleepstudy etc.?)
* mention conditional modes/BLUPs

## lecture 2: workflow

* fitting times? (batch-run file rather than doing it within rmarkdown?)

## lecture 3: frontiers

* image for Wald <-> bootstrap spectrum?
* check Satt/KR glmmTMB vs lme4
* predictive simulation example
* allFit example? plotting?

* other platforms (INLA, brms/rstanarm/etc.)
   * feature table?
* integration methods (GLMM details)
* speed: MixedModels.jl vs glmmTMB vs lme4 on big (crossed) problems?
* conditional distributions, zero-inflation, censoring, etc etc
* dealing with singular fits
* structured covariances (splines etc etc etc)
* inference details:
* causal inference? (DAGs etc; Mundlak)

## stuff from mixed_details.md
