Statistical models that account for grouping or clustering in data (variously called 'multilevel', 'mixed', or 'hierarchical' models) have been around since the 1950s but have continually grown in scope and flexibility. Any time we have observations that violate the nearly universal assumption of independence --- because multiple observations are drawn from the same individual, school class, species, geographic region, ... our statistical models must incorporate this structure or risk inaccuracy and overconfidence.

While the computational tools for fitting and evaluating these models are ever more powerful and convenient, that power brings problems as well. When the data are too sparse for a complex model, how should we simplify or adjust the model? How do we choose among a bewildering range of options? How well do these complex models scale to 'big data', however defined?

This Distinguished Speaker Series seminar will consist of three hours of lecture, held live* via the free video-conferencing software Zoom. Each hour will include a mix of examples, methods, and discussion, including responding to your questions.

The first hour reviews the ideas of mixed models, discusses available software platforms, and briefly outlines some of the challenges in estimation and inference for these models. The second hour presents a general workflow for mixed modeling, illustrated with one or more examples. The third hour revisits the challenges from the first hour in more detail and discusses open questions. Examples will primarily be drawn from ecology and psychology, but the techniques are broadly applicable.

The course is not hands-on, but it will include analyses using R and Stan.

Attendees will get the most out of the seminar if they have a (even dimly remembered) knowledge of basis statistics (Normal distribution, hypothesis testing, etc.) and linear regression. Some knowledge of R will help in following the examples.


BIO:

Benjamin Bolker, PhD, is a professor in the departments of Mathematics & Statistics and Biology at McMaster University.

Professor Bolker has broad interests in computational statistics and population biology including mixed models, infectious disease dynamics, evolution of virulence, animal movement, and spatial population dynamics. He has published more than 100 peer-reviewed publications (including one listed in the top 25 most-cited papers of the 21st century) as well the book _Ecological Models and Data in R_, which has been a gateway to advanced statistical modeling for many ecologists, and (with Dr. Marta Wayne) a _Very Short Introduction to Infectious Disease_ (Oxford University Press) for general readers.

He is also well known for supporting researchers using mixed models and doing statistical analyses in ecology through his development and maintenance of widely used R packages (`lme4`, `glmmTMB`, `bbmle`), with millions of downloads and tens of thousands of literature citations, as well as answering questions in forums such as Stack Overflow. He directs the School of Computational Science and Engineering at McMaster and serves as associate chair (graduate) for Mathematics. He is a long-time associate editor for the leading ecology and evolution journal _American Naturalist_.
