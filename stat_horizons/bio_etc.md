Thanks for signing the agreement. Next step is to get this on the website so we can start advertising. To do this we will need a short description (including who should attend/any "prerequisites," any computing notes, if necessary) and a digital pic/bio.

For examples, please check out the below pages (if you click on the instructor, you'll be taken to their instructor pages):
https://statisticalhorizons.com/seminars/causal-inference-for-multilevel-data/
https://statisticalhorizons.com/seminars/target-trial-emulation/

If you could get this to us in the next few weeks, that would be great.
